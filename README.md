# TAIL-peq
Thermal Asymmetric Interlaced (TAIL)-PCR based sequencing

Whole-genome genotyping (WGG) stands as a pivotal element in genomic-assisted plant breeding. Nevertheless, sequencing-based approaches for WGG continue to be costly, primarily attributed to the high expenses associated with library preparation and the laborious protocol. During the prior development of foreground and background integrated genotyping by sequencing (FBI-seq), we serendipitously discovered that any sequence specific primer (SP) inherently possessed the capability to amplify a massive array of stable and reproducible non-specific PCR products, initiated by primer-template mismatched annealing (PTMA) across the genome. Here we further improved the FBI-seq by replacing the adapter ligated by Tn5 transposase with arbitrary degenerate (AD) primer. The protocol for the enhanced FBI-seq unexpectedly mirrors a simplified Thermal Asymmetric Interlaced (TAIL)-PCR, a technique widely employed for isolating flanking sequences. However, the improved TAIL-PCR maximizes the PTMA capabilities of both SP and AD primers. Additionally, leveraging next-generation sequencing to detect tens of thousands of genome-wide loci for any species. This cost-effective, user-friendly, and powerful WGG tool holds great potential for widespread application in breeding programs, thereby facilitating genome-assisted crop improvement.

Here is the sequencing data analyses pipeline for TAIL-peq method.
